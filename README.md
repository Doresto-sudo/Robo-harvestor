My team spearheaded the development of a cutting-edge robot prototype for an Agriculture-themed robotics competition. Collaborating closely, we seamlessly
integrated hardware components, advanced sensors, and 3D-printed parts.
Our innovative design allowed the robot to navigate diverse environments autonomously while employing precision techniques to identify and harvest ripe fruits.
This project showcased our collective expertise in hardware-software integration and our commitment to advancing agricultural technology.
